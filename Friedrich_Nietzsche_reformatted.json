It is not only pleasant and agreeable images that he experiences with such universal understanding: the serious, the gloomy, the sad and the profound, the sudden restraints, the mockeries of chance, fearful expectations, in short the whole 'divine comedy' of life, the Inferno included, passes before him, not only as a shadow-play \u2014 for he too lives and suffers through these scenes \u2014 and yet also not without that fleeting sense of illusion; and perhaps many, like myself, can remember calling out to themselves in encouragement, amid the perils and terrors of the dream, and with success: 'It is a dream! I want to dream on!' Just as I have often been told of people who have been able to continue one and the same dream over three and more successive nights: facts which clearly show that our innermost being, our common foundation, experiences dreams with profound pleasure and joyful necessity.\n**p. 15.\n\n* ''...in diesen Sanct-Johann- und Sanct-Veitt\u00e4nzern erkennen wir die bacchischen Ch\u00f6re der Griechen wieder, mit ihrer Vorgeschichte in Kleinasien, bis hin zu Babylon und den orgiastischen Sak\u00e4en. Es giebt Menschen, die, aus Mangel an Erfahrung oder aus Stumpfsinn, sich von solchen Erscheinungen wie von \"Volkskrankheiten\", sp\u00f6ttisch oder bedauernd im Gef\u00fchl der eigenen Gesundheit abwenden: die Armen ahnen freilich nicht, wie leichenfarbig und gespenstisch eben diese ihre \"Gesundheit\" sich ausnimmt, wenn an ihnen das gl\u00fchende Leben dionysischer Schw\u00e4rmer vor\u00fcberbraust.''\n** In these dancers of Saint John and Saint Vitus we can recognize the Bacchic choruses of the Greeks, with their prehistory in Asia Minor, as far back as Babylon and the orgiastic Sacaea. Some people, either through a lack of experience or through obtuseness, turn away with pity or contempt from phenomena such as these as from 'folk diseases', bolstered by a sense of their own sanity; these poor creatures have no idea how blighted and ghostly this 'sanity' of theirs sounds when the glowing life of Dionysiac revellers thunders past them.\n**p. 17.\n\n* ''Es geht die alte Sage, dass K\u00f6nig Midas lange Zeit nach dem weisen Silen, dem Begleiter des Dionysus, im Walde gejagt habe, ohne ihn zu fangen. Als er ihm endlich in die H\u00e4nde gefallen ist, fragt der K\u00f6nig, was f\u00fcr den Menschen das Allerbeste und Allervorz\u00fcglichste sei. Starr und unbeweglich schweigt der D\u00e4mon; bis er, durch den K\u00f6nig gezwungen, endlich unter gellem Lachen in diese Worte ausbricht: `Elendes Eintagsgeschlecht, des Zufalls Kinder und der M\u00fchsal, was zwingst du mich dir zu sagen, was nicht zu h\u00f6ren f\u00fcr dich das Erspriesslichste ist? Das Allerbeste ist f\u00fcr dich g\u00e4nzlich unerreichbar: nicht geboren zu sein, nicht zu sein, nichts zu sein. Das Zweitbeste aber ist f\u00fcr dich - bald zu sterben.''\n** According to the old story, King Midas had long hunted wise ''Silenus'', Dionysus' companion, without catching him. When Silenus had finally fallen into his clutches, the king asked him what was the best and most desirable thing of all for mankind. The daemon stood still, stiff and motionless, until at last, forced by the king, he gave a shrill laugh and spoke these words: 'Miserable, ephemeral race, children of hazard and hardship, why do you force me to say what it would be much more fruitful for you not to hear? The best of all things is something entirely outside your grasp: not to be born, not to ''be'', to be ''nothing''. But the second-best thing for you \u2014 is to die soon.'\n**p. 22.\n\n* ''Der philosophische Mensch hat sogar das Vorgef\u00fchl, dass auch unter dieser Wirklichkeit, in der wir leben und sind, eine zweite ganz andre verborgen liege...''\n** Underneath this reality in which we live and have our being, another and altogether different reality lies concealed...\n**p. 23, William Haussmann translation\n\n* ''Mit dem Tode der griechischen Trag\u00f6die dagegen entstand eine ungeheure, \u00fcberall tief empfundene Leere; wie einmal griechische Schiffer zu Zeiten des Tiberius an einem einsamen Eiland den ersch\u00fctternden Schrei h\u00f6rten \"der grosse Pan ist todt\": so klang es jetzt wie ein schmerzlicher Klageton durch die hellenische Welt: \"die Trag\u00f6die ist todt! Die Poesie selbst ist mit ihr verloren gegangen! Fort, fort mit euch verk\u00fcmmerten, abgemagerten Epigonen! Fort in den Hades, damit ihr euch dort an den Brosamen der vormaligen Meister einmal satt essen k\u00f6nnt!\"''\n** Greek tragedy met her death in a different way from all the older sister arts: she died tragically by her own hand, after irresolvable conflicts, while the others died happy and peaceful at an advanced age. If a painless death, leaving behind beautiful progeny, is the sign of a happy natural state, then the endings of the other arts show us the example of just such a happy natural state: they sink slowly, and with their dying eyes they behold their fairer offspring, who lift up their heads in bold impatience. The death of Greek tragedy, on the other hand, left a great void whose effects were felt profoundly, far and wide; as once Greek sailors in Tiberius' time heard the distressing cry 'the god Pan is dead' issuing from a lonely island, now, throughout the Hellenic world, this cry resounded like an agonized lament: 'Tragedy is dead! Poetry itself died with it! Away, away with you, puny, stunted imitators! Away with you to Hades, and eat your fill of the old masters' crumbs!'\n**p. 54.\n\n* Bei diesem Zusammenhange ist die leidenschaftliche Zuneigung begreiflich, welche die Dichter der neueren Kom\u00f6die zu Euripides empfanden; so dass der Wunsch des Philemon nicht weiter befremdet, der sich sogleich aufh\u00e4ngen lassen mochte, nur um den Euripides in der Unterwelt aufsuchen zu k\u00f6nnen: wenn er nur \u00fcberhaupt \u00fcberzeugt sein d\u00fcrfte, dass der Verstorbene auch jetzt noch bei Verstande sei.\n** This context enables us to understand the passionate affection in which the poets of the New Comedy held Euripides; so that we are no longer startled by the desire of Philemon, who wished to be hanged at once so that he might meet Euripides in the underworld, so long as he could be sure that the deceased was still in full possession of his senses.\n**p. 55.\n\n* ''...aesthetischen Sokratismus...dessen oberstes Gesetz ungef\u00e4hr so lautet: \"alles muss verst\u00e4ndig sein, um sch\u00f6n zu sein\"; als Parallelsatz zu dem sokratischen \"nur der Wissende ist tugendhaft.\"''\n** ...''aesthetic Socratism'', the chief law of which is, more or less: \"to be beautiful everything must first be intelligible\" \u2014 a parallel to the Socratic dictum: \"only the one who knows is virtuous.\"\n**p. 62.\n\n* ''Nun aber schien Sokrates die tragische Kunst nicht einmal \"die Wahrheit zu sagen\": abgesehen davon, dass sie sich an den wendet, der \"nicht viel Verstand besitzt\", also nicht an den Philosophen: ein zweifacher Grund, von ihr fern zu bleiben. Wie Plato, rechnete er sie zu den schmeichlerischen K\u00fcnsten, die nur das Angenehme, nicht das N\u00fctzliche darstellen und verlangte deshalb bei seinen J\u00fcngern Enthaltsamkeit und strenge Absonderung von solchen unphilosophischen Reizungen; mit solchem Erfolge, dass der jugendliche Trag\u00f6diendichter Plato zu allererst seine Dichtungen verbrannte, um Sch\u00fcler des Sokrates werden zu k\u00f6nnen.''\n** But for [[Socrates]], tragedy did not even seem to \"tell what's true\", quite apart from the fact that it addresses \"those without much wit\", not the philosopher: another reason for giving it a wide berth. Like [[Plato]], he numbered it among the flattering arts which represent only the agreeable, not the useful, and therefore required that his disciples abstain most rigidly from such unphilosophical stimuli \u2014 with such success that the young tragedian, Plato, burnt his writings in order to become a pupil of Socrates.\n**p. 68.\n\n* ''Darum hat Lessing, der ehrlichste theoretische Mensch, es auszusprechen gewagt, dass ihm mehr am Suchen der Wahrheit als an ihr selbst gelegen sei...''\n** [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], the most honest of theoretical men, dared to say that he took greater delight in the quest for truth than in the truth itself.\n**p. 73.\n\n* ''...der kann sich nicht entbrechen, in Sokrates den einen Wendepunkt und Wirbel der sogenannten Weltgeschichte zu sehen. Denn d\u00e4chte man sich einmal diese ganze unbezifferbare Summe von Kraft, die f\u00fcr jene Welttendenz verbraucht worden ist, nicht im Dienste des Erkennens, sondern auf die praktischen d.h. egoistischen Ziele der Individuen und V\u00f6lker verwendet, so w\u00e4re wahrscheinlich in allgemeinen Vernichtungsk\u00e4mpfen und fortdauernden V\u00f6lkerwanderungen die instinctive Lust zum Leben so abgeschw\u00e4cht, dass, bei der Gewohnheit des Selbstmordes, der Einzelne vielleicht den letzten Rest von Pflichtgef\u00fchl empfinden m\u00fcsste, wenn er, wie der Bewohner der Fidschiinseln, als Sohn seine Eltern, als Freund seinen Freund erdrosselt: ein praktischer Pessimismus, der selbst eine grausenhafte Ethik des V\u00f6lkermordes aus Mitleid erzeugen k\u00f6nnte - der \u00fcbrigens \u00fcberall in der Welt vorhanden ist und vorhanden war, wo nicht die Kunst in irgend welchen Formen, besonders als Religion und Wissenschaft, zum Heilmittel und zur Abwehr jenes Pesthauchs erschienen ist.''\n** '''We cannot help but see Socrates as the turning-point, the vortex of world history.''' For if we imagine that the whole incalculable store of energy used in that global tendency had been used ''not'' in the service of knowledge but in ways applied to the practical \u2014 selfish \u2014 goals of individuals and nations, universal wars of destruction and constant migrations of peoples would have enfeebled man's instinctive zest for life to the point where, suicide having become universal, the individual would perhaps feel a vestigial duty as a son to strangle his parents, or as a friend his friend, as the Fiji islanders do: a practical pessimism that could even produce a terrible ethic of genocide through pity, and which is, and always has been, present everywhere in the world where art has not in some form, particularly as religion and science, appeared as a remedy and means of prevention for this breath of pestilence.\n**p. 73.\n\n* ''Aber wie ver\u00e4ndert sich pl\u00f6tzlich jene eben so d\u00fcster geschilderte Wildniss unserer erm\u00fcdeten Cultur, wenn sie der dionysische Zauber ber\u00fchrt!

A storm seizes everything decrepit, rotten, broken, stunted; shrouds it in a whirling red cloud of dust and carries it into the air like a vulture. In vain confusion we seek for all that has vanished; for what we see has risen as if from beneath he earth into the gold light, so full and green, so luxuriantly alive, immeasurable and filled with yearning. Tragedy sits in sublime rapture amidst this abundance of life, suffering and delight, listening to a far-off, melancholy song which tells of the Mothers of Being, whose names are Delusion, Will, Woe <br> Yes, my friends, join me in my faith in this Dionysiac life and the rebirth of tragedy.

That was the highest and most mendacious minute of \"world history\" \u2014 yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die.<br> One might invent such a fable and still not have illustrated sufficiently how wretched, how shadowy and flighty, how aimless and arbitrary, the human intellect appears in nature. There have been eternities when it did not exist; and when it is done for again, nothing will have happened.\n\n* '''The pride connected with knowing and sensing lies like a blinding fog over the eyes and senses of men, thus deceiving them concerning the value of existence.''' For this pride contains within itself the most flattering estimation of the value of knowing. Deception is the most general effect of such pride, but even its most particular effects contain within themselves something of the same deceitful character.\n\n* Deception, flattering, lying, deluding, talking behind the back, putting up a false front, living in borrowed splendor, wearing a mask, hiding behind convention, playing a role for others and for oneself \u2014 in short, a continuous fluttering around the solitary flame of vanity \u2014 is so much the rule and the law among men that there is almost nothing which is less comprehensible than how an honest and pure drive for truth could have arisen among them. They are deeply immersed in illusions and in dream images; their eyes merely glide over the surface of things and see \"forms.\"\n** Variant translation: The constant fluttering around the single flame of vanity is so much the rule and the law that almost nothing is more incomprehensible than how an honest and pure urge for truth could make its appearance among men.\n\n* '''What does man actually know about himself?''' Is he, indeed, ever able to perceive himself completely, as if laid out in a lighted display case? Does nature not conceal most things from him \u2014 even concerning his own body \u2014 in order to confine and lock him within a proud, deceptive consciousness, aloof from the coils of the bowels, the rapid flow of the blood stream, and the intricate quivering of the fibers! She threw away the key.\n\n* '''The liar is a person who uses the valid designations, the words, in order to make something which is unreal appear to be real.''' He says, for example, \"I am rich,\" when the proper designation for his condition would be \"poor.\" He misuses fixed conventions by means of arbitrary substitutions or even reversals of names. If he does this in a selfish and moreover harmful manner, society will cease to trust him and will thereby exclude him. '''What men avoid by excluding the liar is not so much being defrauded as it is being harmed by means of fraud. Thus, even at this stage, what they hate is basically not deception itself, but rather the unpleasant, hated consequences of certain sorts of deception. It is in a similarly restricted sense that man now wants nothing but truth: he desires the pleasant, life-preserving consequences of truth.''' He is indifferent toward pure knowledge which has no consequences; toward those truths which are possibly harmful and destructive he is even hostilely inclined.\n\n* '''Are designations congruent with things? Is language the adequate expression of all realities?''' <br> It is only by means of forgetfulness that man can ever reach the point of fancying himself to possess a \"truth\" of the grade just indicated. '''If he will not be satisfied with truth in the form of tautology, that is to say, if he will not be content with empty husks, then he will always exchange truths for illusions.'''\n\n* '''The various languages placed side by side show that with words it is never a question of truth, never a question of adequate expression; otherwise, there would not be so many languages.''' The \"thing in itself\" (which is precisely what the pure truth, apart from any of its consequences, would be) is likewise something quite incomprehensible to the creator of language and something not in the least worth striving for. '''This creator only designates the relations of things to men, and for expressing these relations he lays hold of the boldest metaphors.'''' To begin with, a nerve stimulus is transferred into an image: first metaphor. The image, in turn, is imitated in a sound: second metaphor. And each time there is a complete overleaping of one sphere, right into the middle of an entirely new and different one.\n\n* '''We believe that we know something about the things themselves when we speak of trees, colors, snow, and flowers; and yet we possess nothing but metaphors for things \u2014 metaphors which correspond in no way to the original entities.'''\n\n* Every word instantly becomes a concept precisely insofar as it is not supposed to serve as a reminder of the unique and entirely individual original experience to which it owes its origin; but rather, a word becomes a concept insofar as it simultaneously has to fit countless more or less similar cases \u2014 which means, purely and simply, cases which are never equal and thus altogether unequal. '''Every concept arises from the equation of unequal things.''' Just as it is certain that one leaf is never totally the same as another, so it is certain that the concept \"leaf\" is formed by arbitrarily discarding these individual differences and by forgetting the distinguishing aspects.\n\n* '''We obtain the concept, as we do the form, by overlooking what is individual and actual; whereas nature is acquainted with no forms and no concepts, and likewise with no species, but only with an X which remains inaccessible and undefinable for us.'''\n\n* ''Was ist also Wahrheit? Ein bewegliches Heer von Metaphern, Metonymien, Anthropomorphismen, kurz eine Summe von menschlichen Relationen, die, poetisch und rhetorisch gesteigert, \u00fcbertragen, geschm\u00fcckt wurden, und die nach langem Gebrauch einem Volke fest, kanonisch und verbindlich d\u00fcnken: die Wahrheiten sind Illusionen, von denen man vergessen hat, da\u00df sie welche sind, Metaphern, die abgenutzt und sinnlich kraftlos geworden sind, M\u00fcnzen, die ihr Bild verloren haben und nun als Metall, nicht mehr als M\u00fcnzen, in Betracht kommen.''\n** '''What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding.''' Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions \u2014 they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins.\n\n* We still do not yet know where the drive for truth comes from. For so far we have heard only of the duty which society imposes in order to exist: '''to be truthful means to employ the usual metaphors.''' Thus, to express it morally, this is the duty to lie according to a fixed convention, to lie with the herd and in a manner binding upon everyone. Now man of course forgets that this is the way things stand for him. Thus he lies in the manner indicated, unconsciously and in accordance with habits which are centuries' old; and precisely by means of this unconsciousness and forgetfulness he arrives at his sense of truth.\n\n* The venerability, reliability, and utility of truth is something which a person demonstrates for himself from the contrast with the liar, whom no one trusts and everyone excludes. '''As a \"rational\" being, he now places his behavior under the control of abstractions. He will no longer tolerate being carried away by sudden impressions, by intuitions.'''\n\n* '''Everything which distinguishes man from the animals depends upon this ability to volatilize perceptual metaphors in a schema, and thus to dissolve an image into a concept.''' For something is possible in the realm of these schemata which could never be achieved with the vivid first impressions: the construction of a pyramidal order according to castes and degrees, the creation of a new world of laws, privileges, subordinations, and clearly marked boundaries \u2014 a new world, one which now confronts that other vivid world of first impressions as more solid, more universal, better known, and more human than the immediately perceived world, and thus as the regulative and imperative world.\n\n* One may certainly admire man as a mighty genius of construction, who succeeds in piling an infinitely complicated dome of concepts upon an unstable foundation, and, as it were, on running water. Of course, in order to be supported by such a foundation, his construction must be like one constructed of spiders' webs: delicate enough to be carried along by the waves, strong enough not to be blown apart by every wind.\n\n* As a genius of construction man raises himself far above the bee in the following way: whereas the bee builds with wax that he gathers from nature, man builds with the far more delicate conceptual material which he first has to manufacture from himself.\n\n* '''When someone hides something behind a bush and looks for it again in the same place and finds it there as well, there is not much to praise in such seeking and finding. Yet this is how matters stand regarding seeking and finding \"truth\" within the realm of reason. If I make up the definition of a mammal, and then, after inspecting a camel, declare \"look, a mammal' I have indeed brought a truth to light in this way, but it is a truth of limited value.''' That is to say, it is a thoroughly anthropomorphic truth which contains not a single point which would be \"true in itself\" or really and universally valid apart from man. At bottom, what the investigator of such truths is seeking is only the metamorphosis of the world into man.\n\n* '''Only by forgetting this primitive world of metaphor can one live with any repose, security, and consistency''': only by means of the petrification and coagulation of a mass of images which originally streamed from the primal faculty of human imagination like a fiery liquid, only in the invincible faith that this sun, this window, this table is a truth in itself, in short, '''only by forgetting that he himself is an artistically creating subject, does man live with any repose, security, and consistency. If but for an instant he could escape from the prison walls of this faith, his \"self consciousness\" would be immediately destroyed.''' It is even a difficult thing for him to admit to himself that the insect or the bird perceives an entirely different world from the one that man does, and that the question of which of these perceptions of the world is the more correct one is quite meaningless, for this would have to have been decided previously in accordance with the criterion of the correct perception, which means, in accordance with a criterion which is not available.\n\n* '''Between two absolutely different spheres, as between subject and object, there is no causality, no correctness, and no expression; there is, at most, an aesthetic relation''': I mean, a suggestive transference, a stammering translation into a completely foreign tongue \u2014 for which I there is required, in any case, a freely inventive intermediate sphere and mediating force.''' \"Appearance\" is a word that contains many temptations, which is why I avoid it as much as possible. For it is not true that the essence of things \"appears\" in the empirical world.''' A painter without hands who wished to express in song the picture before his mind would, by means of this substitution of spheres, still reveal more about the essence of things than does the empirical world. '''Even the relationship of a nerve stimulus to the generated image is not a necessary one.''' But when the same image has been generated millions of times and has been handed down for many generations and finally appears on the same occasion every time for all mankind, then it acquires at last the same meaning for men it would have if it were the sole necessary image and if the relationship of the original nerve stimulus to the generated image were a strictly causal one. In the same manner, an eternally repeated dream would certainly be felt and judged to be reality. But '''the hardening and congealing of a metaphor guarantees absolutely nothing concerning its necessity and exclusive justification.'''\n\n* If each us had a different kind of sense perception \u2014 if we could only perceive things now as a bird, now as a worm, now as a plant, or if one of us saw a stimulus as red, another as blue, while a third even heard the same stimulus as a sound \u2014 then no one would speak of such a regularity of nature, rather, nature would be grasped only as a creation which is subjective in the highest degree. After all, '''what is a law of nature as such for us? We are not acquainted with it in itself, but only with its effects, which means in its relation to other laws of nature \u2014 which, in turn, are known to us only as sums of relations. Therefore all these relations always refer again to others and are thoroughly incomprehensible to us in their essence.'''\n\n* We produce these representations in and from ourselves with the same necessity with which the spider spins. '''If we are forced to comprehend all things only under these forms, then it ceases to be amazing that in all things we actually comprehend nothing but these forms.''' For they must all bear within themselves the laws of number, and it is precisely number which is most astonishing in things. '''All that conformity to law, which impresses us so much in the movement of the stars and in chemical processes, coincides at bottom with those properties which we bring to things.''' Thus it is we who impress ourselves in this way\n\n[[File:Balestriere1.jpg|thumb|right|The drive toward the formation of [[metaphors]] is the fundamental [[human]] drive, which one cannot for a single instant dispense with in [[thought]], for one would thereby dispense with [[man]] himself.]]\n[[File:Tree of Life 2009 large.png|thumb|right|There is no regular path which leads from these intuitions into the land of ghostly schemata, the land of [[abstractions]].

Just as the bee simultaneously constructs cells and fills them with honey, so science works unceasingly on this great columbarium of concepts, the graveyard of perceptions.\n\n* '''Whereas the man of action binds his life to reason and its concepts so that he will not be swept away and lost, the scientific investigator builds his hut right next to the tower of science so that he will be able to work on it and to find shelter for himself beneath those bulwarks which presently exist.''' And he requires shelter, for there are frightful powers which continuously break in upon him, powers which oppose scientific \"truth\" with completely different kinds of \"truths\" which bear on their shields the most varied sorts of emblems.\n\n* '''The drive toward the formation of metaphors is the fundamental human drive, which one cannot for a single instant dispense with in thought, for one would thereby dispense with man himself.''' This drive is not truly vanquished and scarcely subdued by the fact that a regular and rigid new world is constructed as its prison from its own ephemeral products, the concepts. It seeks a new realm and another channel for its activity, and it finds this in myth and in art generally. This drive continually confuses the conceptual categories and cells by bringing forward new transferences, metaphors, and metonymies. '''It continually manifests an ardent desire to refashion the world which presents itself to waking man, so that it will be as colorful, irregular, lacking in results and coherence, charming, and eternally new as the world of dreams.''' Indeed, it is only by means of the rigid and regular web of concepts that the waking man clearly sees that he is awake; and it is precisely because of this that he sometimes thinks that he must be dreaming when this web of concepts is torn by art.\n\n* Because of the way that myth takes it for granted that miracles are always happening, the waking life of a mythically inspired people \u2014 the ancient Greeks, for instance \u2014 more closely resembles a dream than it does the waking world of a scientifically disenchanted thinker.\n\n* '''Man has an invincible inclination to allow himself to be deceived and is, as it were, enchanted with happiness when the rhapsodist tells him epic fables as if they were true, or when the actor in the theater acts more royally than any real king.''' So long as it is able to deceive without injuring, that master of deception, the intellect, is free; it is released from its former slavery and celebrates its Saturnalia. It is never more luxuriant, richer, prouder, more clever and more daring.\n\n*'''That immense framework and planking of concepts to which the needy man clings his whole life long in order to preserve himself is nothing but a scaffolding and toy for the most audacious feats of the liberated intellect.''' And when it smashes this framework to pieces, throws it into confusion, and puts it back together in an ironic fashion, pairing the most alien things and separating the closest, it is demonstrating that it has no need of these makeshifts of indigence and that it will now be guided by intuitions rather than by concepts. '''There is no regular path which leads from these intuitions into the land of ghostly schemata, the land of abstractions. There exists no word for these intuitions; when man sees them he grows dumb, or else he speaks only in forbidden metaphors and in unheard \u2014 of combinations of concepts.''' He does this so that by shattering and mocking the old conceptual barriers he may at least correspond creatively to the impression of the powerful present intuition.\n\n* '''There are ages in which the rational man and the intuitive man stand side by side, the one in fear of intuition, the other with scorn for abstraction.''' The latter is just as irrational as the former is inartistic. They both desire to rule over life: the former, by knowing how to meet his principle needs by means of foresight, prudence, and regularity; the latter, by disregarding these needs and, as an \"overjoyed hero,\" counting as real only that life which has been disguised as illusion and beauty.\n\n* '''The man who is guided by concepts and abstractions only succeeds by such means in warding off misfortune, without ever gaining any happiness for himself from these abstractions. And while he aims for the greatest possible freedom from pain, the intuitive man, standing in the midst of a culture, already reaps from his intuition a harvest of continually inflowing illumination, cheer, and redemption \u2014 in addition to obtaining a defense against misfortune.''' To be sure, he suffers more intensely, when he suffers; he even suffers more frequently, since he does not understand how to learn from experience and keeps falling over and over again into the same ditch.\n\n=== ''Untimely Meditations'' (1876) ===\n[[File:Potok pod jezerom 1.jpg|thumb|right|No one can construct for you the bridge upon which precisely you must cross the stream of life, no one but you yourself alone.]]\n\n* In order to be able thus to misjudge, and thus to grant left-handed veneration to our classics, people must have ceased to know them.

With the view of ensuring their own tranquility, these smug ones even appropriated history, and sought to transform all sciences that threatened to disturb their wretched ease into branches of history. \u2026 No, in their desire to acquire an historical grasp of everything, stultification became the sole aim of these philosophical admirers of \u201c''[[w:nil admirari|nil admirari]]''.\u201d While professing to hate every form of fanaticism and intolerance, what they really hated, at bottom, was the dominating genius and the tyranny of the real claims of culture.\n** ([[w:Anthony Ludovici|A.

I believed that, when the time came, I would discover a philosopher to educate me, a true philosopher whom one could follow without any misgiving because one would have more faith in him than one had in oneself. Then I asked myself: what would be the principles by which he would educate you?\u2014and I reflected on what he might say about the two educational maxims which are being hatched in our time. One of them demands that the educator should quickly recognize the real strength of his pupil and then direct all his efforts and energy and heat at them so as to help that one virtue to attain true maturity and fruitfulness. The other maxim, on the contrary, requires that the educator should draw forth and nourish all the forces which exist in his pupil and bring them to a harmonious relationship with one another. \u2026 But where do we discover a harmonious whole at all, a simultaneous sounding of many voice in one nature, if not in such men as [[Benvenuto Cellini|Cellini]], men in whom everything, knowledge, desire, love, hate, strives towards a central point, a root force, and where a harmonious system is constructed through the compelling domination of this living centre? And so perhaps these two maxims are not opposites at all? Perhaps the one simply says that man should have a center and the other than he should also have a periphery?

Looking at the coast from that perspective, we survey for the first time its entire shape, and when we near it again, we have the advantage of understanding it better on the whole than do those who have never left it.\n** Section IX, \"Man Alone with Himself\" / aphorism 616.\n\n* ''Philosophisch gesinnt sein. - Gew\u00f6hnlich strebt man darnach, f\u00fcr alle Lebenslagen und Ereignisse eine Haltung des Gem\u00fcthes, eine Gattung von Ansichten zu erwerben, - das nennt man vornehmlich philosophisch gesinnt sein. Aber f\u00fcr die Bereicherung der Erkenntniss mag es h\u00f6heren Werth haben, nicht in dieser Weise sich zu uniformiren, sondern auf die leise Stimme der verschiedenen Lebenslagen zu h\u00f6ren; diese bringen ihre eigenen Ansichten mit sich. So nimmt man erkennenden Antheil am Leben und Wesen Vieler, indem man sich selber nicht als starres, best\u00e4ndiges, Eines Individuum behandelt.''\n** <i>A philosophical frame of mind</i>. Generally we strive to acquire one emotional stance, one viewpoint for all life situations and events: we usually call that being of a philosophical frame of mind. But rather than making oneself uniform, we may find greater value for the enrichment of knowledge by listening to the soft voice of different life situations; each brings its own views with it. Thus we acknowledge and <b>share the life and nature of many by not treating ourselves like rigid, invariable, single individuals</b>.\n** Section IX, \"Man Alone with Himself\" / aphorism 618.\n\n* ''Verkehr mit dem h\u00f6heren Selbst. - Ein jeder hat seinen guten Tag, wo er sein h\u00f6heres Selbst findet; und die wahre Humanit\u00e4t verlangt, jemanden nur nach diesem Zustande und nicht nach den Werktagen der Unfreiheit und Knechtung zu sch\u00e4tzen. Man soll zum Beispiel einen Maler nach seiner h\u00f6chsten Vision, die er zu sehen und darzustellen vermochte, taxiren und verehren. Aber die Menschen selber verkehren sehr verschieden mit diesem ihrem h\u00f6heren Selbst und sind h\u00e4ufig ihre eigenen Schauspieler, insofern sie Das, was sie in jenen Augenblicken sind, sp\u00e4ter immer wieder nachmachen. Manche leben in Scheu und Demuth vor ihrem Ideale und m\u00f6chten es verleugnen: sie f\u00fcrchten ihr h\u00f6heres Selbst, weil es, wenn es redet, anspruchsvoll redet. Dazu hat es eine geisterhafte Freiheit zu kommen und fortzubleiben wie es will; es wird desswegen h\u00e4ufig eine Gabe der G\u00f6tter genannt, w\u00e4hrend eigentlich alles Andere Gabe der G\u00f6tter (des Zufalls) ist: jenes aber ist der Mensch selber.''\n** <i>Traffic with one's higher self</i>. Everyone has his good day, when he finds his higher self; and true humanity demands that we judge someone only when he is in this condition, and not in his workdays of bondage and servitude. We should, for example, assess and honor a painter according to the highest vision he was able to see and portray. But people themselves deal very differently with this, their higher self, and often act out the role of their own self, to the extent that they later keep imitating what they were in those moments. Some regard their ideal with shy humility and would like to deny it: they fear their higher self because, when it speaks, it speaks demandingly. In addition, it has a ghostly freedom of coming or staying away as it wishes; for that reason it is often called a gift of the gods, while actually everything else is a gift of the gods (of chance): this, however, is the man himself.\n** Section IX, \"Man Alone with Himself\" / aphorism 624.\n\n* ''Leben und Erleben. - Sieht man zu, wie Einzelne mit ihren Erlebnissen - ihren unbedeutenden allt\u00e4glichen Erlebnissen - umzugehen wissen, so dass diese zu einem Ackerland werden, das dreimal des Jahres Frucht tr\u00e4gt; w\u00e4hrend Andere - und wie Viele! - durch den Wogenschlag der aufregendsten Schicksale, der mannigfaltigsten Zeit- und Volksstr\u00f6mungen hindurchgetrieben werden und doch immer leicht, immer obenauf, wie Kork, bleiben: so ist man endlich versucht, die Menschheit in eine Minorit\u00e4t (Minimalit\u00e4t) Solcher einzutheilen, welche aus Wenigem Viel zu machen verstehen: und in eine Majorit\u00e4t Derer, welche aus Vielem Wenig zu machen verstehen; ja man trifft auf jene umgekehrten Hexenmeister, welche, anstatt die Welt aus Nichts, aus der Welt ein Nichts schaffen.''\n** <i>Life and experience</i>. If one notices how some individuals know how to treat their experiences (their insignificant everyday experiences) so that these become a plot of ground that bears fruit three times a year; while others (and how many of them!) are driven through the waves of the most exciting turns of fate, of the most varied currents of their time or nation, and yet always stay lightly on the surface, like cork: then one is finally tempted to divide mankind into a minority (minimality) of those people who know how to make much out of little and a majority of those who know how to make a little out of much; indeed, one meets those perverse wizards who, instead of <b>creating the world out of nothing, create nothing out of the world<b>.\n** Section IX, \"Man Alone with Himself\" / aphorism 627.\n\n* ''Es ist nicht der Kampf der Meinungen, welcher die Geschichte so gewaltth\u00e4tig gemacht hat, sondern der Kampf des Glaubens an die Meinungen, das heisst der Ueberzeugungen.''\n** It is not the struggle of opinions that has made history so violent, but rather the struggle of belief in opinions, that is, the struggle of convictions.\n** Section IX, \"Man Alone with Himself\" / excerpt from aphorism 630.\n\n* ''Wir sind im Wesentlichen noch dieselben Menschen, wie die des Zeitalters der Reformation: wie sollte es auch anders sein? Aber dass wir uns einige Mittel nicht mehr erlauben, um mit ihnen unsrer Meinung zum Siege zu verhelfen, das hebt uns gegen jene Zeit ab und beweist, dass wir einer h\u00f6hern Cultur angeh\u00f6ren. Wer jetzt noch, in der Art der Reformations-Menschen, Meinungen mit Verd\u00e4chtigungen, mit Wuthausbr\u00fcchen bek\u00e4mpft und niederwirft, verr\u00e4th deutlich, dass er seine Gegner verbrannt haben w\u00fcrde, falls er in anderen Zeiten gelebt h\u00e4tte, und dass er zu allen Mitteln der Inquisition seine Zuflucht genommen haben w\u00fcrde, wenn er als Gegner der Reformation gelebt h\u00e4tte. Diese Inquisition war damals vern\u00fcnftig, denn sie bedeutete nichts Anderes, als den allgemeinen Belagerungszustand, welcher \u00fcber den ganzen Bereich der Kirche verh\u00e4ngt werden musste, und der, wie jeder Belagerungszustand, zu den \u00e4ussersten Mitteln berechtigte, unter der Voraussetzung n\u00e4mlich (welche wir jetzt nicht mehr mit jenen Menschen theilen), dass man die Wahrheit, in der Kirche, habe, und um jeden Preis mit jedem Opfer zum Heile der Menschheit bewahren m\u00fcsse. Jetzt aber giebt man Niemandem so leicht mehr zu, dass er die Wahrheit habe: die strengen Methoden der Forschung haben genug Misstrauen und Vorsicht verbreitet, so dass Jeder, welcher gewaltth\u00e4tig in Wort und Werk Meinungen vertritt, als ein Feind unserer jetzigen Cultur, mindestens als ein zur\u00fcckgebliebener empfunden wird. In der That: das Pathos, dass man die Wahrheit habe, gilt jetzt sehr wenig im Verh\u00e4ltniss zu jenem freilich milderen und klanglosen Pathos des Wahrheit-Suchens, welches nicht m\u00fcde wird, umzulernen und neu zu pr\u00fcfen.''\n** Essentially, we are still the same people as those in the period of the Reformation - and how should it be otherwise? But we no longer allow ourselves certain means to gain victory for our opinion: this distinguishes us from that age and proves that we belong to a higher culture. These days, if a man still attacks and crushes opinions with suspicions and outbursts of rage, in the manner of men during the Reformation, he clearly betrays that he would have burnt his opponents, had he lived in other times, and that he would have taken recourse to all the means of the Inquisition, had he lived as an opponent of the Reformation. In its time, the Inquisition was reasonable, for it meant nothing other than the general martial law which had to be proclaimed over the whole domain of the church, and which, like every state of martial law, justified the use of the extremest means, namely under the assumption (which we no longer share with those people) that one possessed truth in the church and had to preserve it at any cost, with any sacrifice, for the salvation of mankind. But <b>now we will no longer concede so easily that anyone has the truth</b>; the rigorous methods of inquiry have spread sufficient distrust and caution, so that we experience every man who represents opinions violently in word and deed as any enemy of our present culture, or at least as a backward person. And in fact, the fervor about having the truth counts very little today in relation to that other fervor, more gentle and silent, to be sure, for seeking the truth, a search that does not tire of learning afresh and testing anew.\n** Section IX, \"Man Alone with Himself\" / aphorism 633.\n\n=== ''Daybreak \u2014 Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality'' (1881)===\n[[File:William Holman Hunt - The Scapegoat.jpg|thumb|right|He who is [[punished]] is never he who performed the [[deed]].

We benefit and show benevolence to those who are already dependent on us in some way (which means that they are used to thinking of us as causes); we want to increase their power because in that way we increase ours, or we want to show them how advantageous it is to be in our power; that way they will become more satisfied with their condition and more hostile to and willing to fight against the enemies of our power.\n** Sec. 13.\n\n* People who live in an age of corruption are witty and slanderous; they know that there are other kinds of murder than by dagger or assault; they also know that '''whatever is ''well said'' is believed...'''\n** Sec. 23.\n\n* '''The reasons and purposes for habits are always lies that are added only after some people begin to attack these habits and to ''ask'' for reasons and purposes.

It is bad enough that precisely when we hear these beautiful words we have the ugliest suspicions. What we find in them is merely an expression \u2014 and a masquerade \u2014 of a profound weakening, of weariness, of old age, of declining energies. What can it matter to us what tinsel the sick may use to cover up their weakness? Let them parade it as their virtue; after all, there is no doubt that weakness makes one mild, oh so mild, so righteous, so inoffensive, so \"humane\"!\n** Sec. 377.\n\n* Preparatory human beings. \u2014 I welcome all signs that a more virile, warlike age is about to begin, which will restore honor to courage above all!

On closer inspection it is war that produces these effects, the war for liberal institutions, which, as a war, permits illiberal instincts to continue. And war educates for freedom. For what is freedom? That one has the will to self-responsibility. That one maintains the distance which separates us. That one becomes more indifferent to difficulties, hardships, privation, even to life itself. That one is prepared to sacrifice human beings for one's cause, not excluding oneself.\n\n* Freedom means that the manly instincts which delight in war and victory dominate over other instincts, for example, over those of \"pleasure.\" The human being who has become free \u2014 and how much more the spirit who has become free \u2014 spits on the contemptible type of well-being dreamed of by shopkeepers, Christians, cows, females, Englishmen, and other democrats. The free man is a warrior. \u2014\n\n* How is freedom measured, in individuals as in nations? By the resistance which must be overcome, by the effort [''M\u00fche''] it costs to remain on top. The highest type of free men should be sought where the highest resistance is constantly overcome: five steps from tyranny, close to the threshold of the danger of servitude. This is true psychologically if by \"tyrants\" are meant inexorable and dreadful instincts that provoke the maximum of authority and discipline against themselves \u2014 most beautiful type: [[Julius Caesar]] \u2014 ; this is true politically too; one need only go through history. The nations which were worth something, became worth something, never became so under liberal institutions: it was great danger that made something of them that merits respect. '''Danger alone acquaints us with our own resources, our virtues, our armor and weapons, our spirit \u2014 and forces us to be strong ...'''\n\n* First principle: one must need to be strong \u2014 otherwise one will never become strong. \u2014 Those large hothouses [''Treibh\u00e4user''] for the strong, for the strongest kind of human being that has ever been, the aristocratic commonwealths of the type of Rome or Venice, understood freedom exactly in the sense in which I understand the word freedom: as something one has and does not have, something one wants, something one conquers ...\n\n* Our institutions are no good any more: on that there is universal agreement. However, it is not their fault but ours. Once we have lost all the instincts out of which institutions grow, we lose institutions altogether because we are no longer good for them.\n\n=== ''[[w:The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' (1888) ===\n[[File:El Greco 011.jpg|thumb|right|The very [[word]] \"[[Christianity]]\" is a misunderstanding \u2014 in [[truth]], there was only one Christian, and he [[died]] on the cross.]]\n:<small>''Der Antichrist'' (1888); [[s:The Antichrist|''The Antichrist'' (English translation at WIkisource)]] [http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/nietzsch/antichri/antichri.htm (German)] ; for more quotes from this work see ''[[The Antichrist]]'' </small>\n[[File:Nietzsche Olde 08.JPG|thumb|right|Against [[boredom]] even [[gods]] struggle in [[vain]].]]\n<!-- MOST of these quotes should be moved to the ''The Antichrist'' page, leaving only a few small quotes here for placeholders and samples. -->\n\n* ''Einige werden posthum geboren.''\n** '''Some are born posthumously.'''\n*** Foreword.\n\n* What is [[good]]?

Nietzsche is the only Western thinker who has fully thought an absolute nothingness, although that nothingness is a deep even if elusive ground of Hegelian thinking, and of all of the fullest expressions of modern dialectical thinking and vision.\n** [[Thomas J. J. Altizer]], ''Godhead and the Nothing'' (2003), Preface\n\n* What is most needed today is a fundamental theological thinking, one centered upon the [[Godhead]] itself, and centered upon that which is most challenging or most offensive in the Godhead, one which has truly been veiled in the modern [[world]], except by our most [[revolutionary]] [[thinkers]] and [[visionaries]].''' If we allow [[William Blake|Blake]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche\u200e\u200e|Nietzsche]] to be paradigmatic of those revolutionaries, nowhere else does such a centering upon God or the Godhead occur, although a full parallel to this occurs in [[Spinoza]] and [[Hegel]]'''; but the language of Hegel and Spinoza is not actually offensive, or not in its immediate impact, whereas the language of Nietzsche and Blake is the most purely offensive language which has ever been inscribed. Above all this is true of the theological language of Blake and Nietzsche, but here a theological language is a truly universal language, one occurring in every domain, and occurring as that [[Nihilism|absolute No]] which is the origin of every repression and every [[darkness]], and a darkness which is finally the darkness of God, or the darkness of that Godhead which is beyond \u201cGod.\u201d '''Only Nietzsche and Blake know a wholly fallen Godhead, a Godhead which is an absolutely alien Nihil, but the full reversal of that Nihil is [[apocalypse]] itself, an apocalypse which is an absolute [[joy]], and Blake and Nietzsche are those very writers who have most evoked that joy.'''\n** [[w:Thomas J. J. Altizer|Thomas J. J. Altizer]], in ''Godhead and the Nothing'' (2003), Preface\n\n* Here we stand before a question which, from the perspective of the Christian proclamation, stands over every individualistic and every collectivistic humanism, old or new. It excludes neither individualism nor collectivism. It bears on the individual and also on society, but always on the concrete individual as distinct from other individuals, and always on the society founded on free reciprocal responsibility. It defends discipline in the face of Nietzsche and freedom in the face of Marx.\n** [[Karl Barth]], \"The Christian Proclamation Here and Now\" (1949)\n\n* \u2026 And of this attack we have to say that it was well aimed, that it centered on the point which was vital for Nietzsche as the most consistent champion and prophet of humanity without the fellow-man. It is another matter, and one that objectively considered is to the praise of Nietzsche, that he thus hurled himself against the strongest and not the weakest point in the opposing front. With his discovery of the Crucified and His host he discovered the Gospel itself in a form which was missed even by the majority of its champions, let alone its opponents, in the 19th century. And by having to attack it in this form, he has done us the good office of bringing before us the fact that we have to keep to this form as unconditionally as he rejected it, in self-evident antithesis not only to him, but to the whole tradition on behalf of which he made this final hopeless sally.\n** [[Karl Barth]], Church Dogmatics, \u2162, 2.(1960)\n\n* '''It is Nietzsche\u2019s merit that he was aware that to philosophize is radically problematic in the cultural, [[historicist]] dispensation. He recognized the terrible intellectual and moral risks involved.''' At the center of his every thought was the question \u201cHow is it possible to do what I am doing?\u201d He tried to apply to his own [[thought]] the [[teachings]] of [[relativism|cultural relativism]]. This practically nobody else does. For example, [[Freud]] says that men are motivated by desire for [[sex]] and [[power]], but he did not apply those motives to explain his own [[science]] or his own scientific activity. But if he can be a true scientist, i.e., motivated by [[love]] of the [[truth]], so can other men, and his description of their motives is thus mortally flawed. Or if he is motivated by sex or power, he is not a scientist, and his science is only one means among many possible to attain those [[ends]]. '''This contradiction runs throughout the [[natural]] and [[social]] sciences. They give an account of things that cannot possibly explain the conduct of their practitioners.'''\n** [[Allan Bloom]], ''The Closing of the American Mind'' (New York: 1988), pp. 203-204.\n\n* '''Greatness by [[nature]] includes a [[power]], but not a will to power.''' \u2026 The great man, whether we comprehend him in the most intense [[activity]] of his [[work]] or in the restful equipoise of his [[forces]], is powerful, involuntarily and composedly powerful, but he is not avid for power.

Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest\u2014 whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories\u2014comes afterwards. These are games; one must first answer. And if it is true, as Nietzsche claims, that a philosopher, to deserve our respect, must preach by example, you can appreciate the importance of that reply, for it will precede the definitive act. These are facts the heart can feel; yet they call for careful study before they become clear to the intellect.\n** [[Albert Camus]], \"The Myth of Sisyphus\"\n\n* If [[Karl Marx|Marx]] is inseparably linked to the growth of communism, it must be admitted that Nietzsche is linked to the emergence of fascism in the twentieth century. The relation of fascism to Nietzsche recalls the relation of the French Revolution to Rousseau. The problem of Nietzsche's connection with fascism is unfortunately not resolved by claiming, as many interpreters of Nietzsche are prone to do, that Nietzsche was no fascist, that he was a violent critic of German nationalism, and that he would have loathed [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. These things are undoubtedly true, and uttering them shows the absurdity of a crude identification of Nietzsche's doctrines with Hitler's ravings. Nietzsche was a man with a noble vision of man's future. His own delicacy, integrity, and courage shine through his writing. He was also free of the crude racism which was to be an important element of fascism, and he had only contempt for political anti-Semitism. But the fact remains that in various ways Nietzsche influenced fascism. Fascism may have abused the words of Nietzsche, but his words are singularly easy to abuse.\n** Werner J. Dannhauser, \"Nietzsche\", in Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, eds. ''History of political philosophy'' 3rd ed.

Otherwise humanism will always be secretly theological. It will be a continuation of God by other means.\n** Terry Eagleton, ''Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflections on the God Debate'' Chapter 1. The Scum of the Earth\n\n* Nietzsche\u2019s thought is best unraveled starting from his famous statement: \u201cGod is dead.\u201d Nietzsche saw Western society as at a full stop and sought the \u201crevaluation of all values\u201d\u2014a new moral order.What had been was worthless, in part because of Darwinian theories that showed human descent from animals. What Nietzsche believed was required were new moral concepts to fill the place left by the departure of the old. [...] <br>Nietzsche sought a new sort of aristocracy of super- or above-men, which would be the ultimate goal of civilized existence. The sources of this Nietzschean idea were several. Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution suggested to Nietzsche the notion of humanity as an evolving species, although Nietzsche emphatically rejected the concept of the superman or above-man as the outcome of a biological process; in a sense, the superman or above-man is a spiritualized form of Darwinism.\n** Alan Ebenstein, ''Hayek's Journey: The Mind of Friedrich Hayek'' (2003), Ch. 2. German and Viennese Intellectual Thought\n\n* Nowadays I prefer to remain silent about Nietzsche. When I was teaching philosophy I often used to lecture on Nietzsche,but I wouldn't do that any more today. If I wanted to be pretentious, I would use 'the genealogy of morals' as the general title of what I am doing. It was Nietzsche who specified the power relation as the general focus, shall we say, of philosophical discourse-whereas for [[Karl Marx|Marx]] it was the production relation. Nietzsche is the philosopher of power,a philosopher who managed to think of power without having to confine himself within a political theory in order to do so. Nietzsche's contemporary presence is increasingly important. But I am tired of people studying him only to produce the same kind of commentaries that are written on [[Hegel]] or [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9|Mallarm\u00e9]]. For myself, I prefer to utilise the writers I like. '''The only valid tribute to thought such as Nietzsche's is precisely to use it''', to deform it, to make it groan and protest. And if commentators then say that I am being faithful or unfaithful to Nietzsche, that is of absolutely no interest.\n** [[Michel Foucault]], \"Prison Talk\" in ''Power/Knowledge''\n\n* Nietzsche was the first to release the desire to know from the sovereignty of knowledge itself: to re-establish the distance and exteriority that Aristotle cancelled.\n** [[Michel Foucault]], ''Lectures on the Will to Know'' (1970), p. 5\n\n* '''The degree of introspection achieved by Nietzsche had never been achieved by anyone, nor is it ever likely to be achieved again.'''\n** [[Sigmund Freud]], in remarks (28 October 1908), as reported in ''Freud, Adler, and Jung'' (1980) by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Arnold Kaufmann]], p. 265\n** Variant: Freud several times said of Nietzsche that he had a more penetrating knowledge of himself than any other man who ever lived or was likely to live.\n*** As reported in ''Freud, Adler, and Jung'' (1980) by Walter Arnold Kaufmann, p. 266 (part of this statement has sometimes been taken as a direct quote of Freud, rather than a summation of what he said).\n\n* '''One indication of the importance of Nietzsche is the pantheon of major twentieth century intellectuals whom he influenced.''' \u00b6 He was an influence on [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Hermann Hesse]], major writers, both of whom won Nobel Prizes. He was an influence on thinkers as diverse in their outlooks as [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Michel Foucault]]. Rand\u2019s politics are classically liberal -- while Foucault\u2019s are far Left, including a stint as a member of the French Communist Party. There is the striking fact that Nietzsche was an atheist, but he was an influence on [[Martin Buber]], one of the most widely-read theologians of the twentieth century.

In their youth they both live in the realm of boundless possibilities and feel an affinity through the exuberance of their noble aspirations. Subsequently they go in opposite directions. Nietzsche remains young, leaving concrete reality as his task assumes existential import. Rohde grows old, bourgeois, stable, and skeptical. Hence courage is a fundamental trait in Nietzsche, plaintive self-irony in Rohde. \u2026 Rohde retained the interests but not the attitudes of his youth; he looked to the world of the Greeks for the object of his contemplation rather than the norm of obligation.\n** [[Karl Jaspers]], ''Nietzsche'', C.

The first is an advance because no one who did not admit the validity of the old maxim could see reason for accepting the new one, and anyone who accepted the old would at once recognize the new as an extension of the same principle. If he rejected it, he would have to reject it as a superfluity, something that went too far, not as something simply heterogeneous from his own ideas of value. But the Nietzschean ethic can be accepted only if we are ready to scrap traditional morals as a mere error and then to put ourselves in a position where we can find no ground for any value judgments at all. \n** [[C.

This in turn is just to $ay that his works do not exhibit the features we have been accustomed to expect of philosophical treatises. And, forgetting that philosophical treatises themselves have been written in the most various styles imaginable, this has often been taken to show that Nietzsche's works are not, in some sense, philosophical.\n** Alexander Nehamas, ''Nietzsche, life as literature.'', Ch. 1. The Most Multifarious Art of Style\n\n* Along with ignoring the [[w:French Revolution|French Revolution]], one of the most telling features of the new books on atheism [cf. [[w:new atheism|new atheism]] ] is their consistent refusal to engage Nietzsche, who, if read correctly, ought to make atheists squirm far more than he has ever caused discomfit to believers. \u00b6 First, he turned the critical methods of the Enlightenment against their inventors and showed that Enlightened faith in progress was just as illusory as belief in an afterlife. Second, he demanded that a critical philosophy stop pretending to be a substitute religion (he shrewdly called [[Hegel]]ian idealism \u201cinsidious theology\u201d). Third, he insisted on the indissoluble bond between Christian doctrine and Christian morality and poured contempt on novelists like [[George Eliot]] for supposing otherwise [...] \u00b6 Perhaps this why Nietzsche said in ''Ecce Homo'', \u201cthe most serious Christians have always been well disposed toward me.\u201d <b>For they at least, unlike [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]], [[Sam Harris|Harris]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]], can see that after Nietzsche a moral critique of the Christian God has become impossible, for it denies the very presupposition that makes its own critique possible. Like Abraham asking if the Lord God of justice could not himself do justice, protest atheism must accept the very norms that Nietzsche showed are essential to the meaning of belief. In Nietzsche alone one reads what the world really looks like ''si Deus non sit'' [''if God does not exist''].</b>\n** Edward T.

But there was nothing quite like the Wagnerians (unless later the Freudians): a pressure group, a party, a church with rituals.

Before there was religion or  even morality, there was the sense and sensibility of the master  class. The master looked upon his body\u2014its strength and beauty,  its demonstrated excellence and reserves of power\u2014and saw and  said that it was good. \u2026 The modern residue of that slave revolt, Nietzsche makes clear, is found not in Christianity, or even in religion, but in the nineteenth-century movements for democracy and socialism ...\n** Corey Robin, ''The Reactionary Mind'' (2011), ch. 3. Garbage and Gravita\n\n* Speaking of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] he [Nietzsche] says: \"How much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!\" Exactly the same may be said of him, with the less reluctance since he has not hesitated to say it of Spinoza. It is obvious that '''in his day-dreams he is a warrior, not a professor; all the men he admires were military. His opinion of women, like every man's, is an objectification of his own emotion towards them, which is obviously one of fear.''' \"[Thou goest to woman?] Forget not thy whip\"\u2014but '''nine women out of ten would get the whip away from him, and he knew it, so he kept away from women, and soothed his wounded vanity with unkind remarks.''' \n** [[Bertrand Russell]], [[A History of Western Philosophy]] (1945), Book Three, Part II, Chapter XXV, \"Nietzsche,\" p. 767\n\n* '''It does not occur to Nietzsche as possible that a man should genuinely feel universal love, obviously because he himself feels almost universal hatred and fear''', which he would fain disguise as lordly indifference. '''His \"noble\" man\u2014who is himself in day-dreams\u2014is a being wholly devoid of sympathy, ruthless, cunning, cruel, concerned only with his own power. King Lear, on the verge of madness, says: \"I will do such things\u2014What they are yet I know not\u2014but they shall be The terror of the earth.\" This is Nietzsche's philosophy in a nutshell.'''\n** Russell, ''ibid''. p. 767\n\n* '''I dislike Nietzsche because he likes the contemplation of pain, because he erects conceit into a duty, because the men whom he most admires are conquerors, whose glory is cleverness in causing men to die.'''\n** Russell, ''ibid''. p. 773\n\n* Central to the [[Adam Smith|Smithian]] approach is our willingness to see critically what we observe around us. The sense of comfort that is often associated with being content with the world as it is can seriously hamper the pursuit of justice. This understanding goes strongly against a line of thought that was powerfully presented by Friedrich Nietzshe. \u2018The Christian resolve to find the world ugly and bad has made the world ugly and bad\u2019, said Nietzshe. I think I can, with some effort, understand what Nietzsche meant, but it is hard for me, even with a lot of effort, to see that Nietzshe\u2019s hypothesis helps us to understand the causation or resilience of the nastiness of the world in which we live. Nor, I must insist (this I do as a thoroughly unreligious person), does it offer any obvious insight into the lives and achievements of Martin Luther King, or Mother Theresa, or Desmond Tutu, who have tried to reduce injustice in the world and have done so with non-negligible success.\n** [[Amartya Sen]], \u201cValues and justice\u201d, ''Journal of Economic Methodology'', Vol. 19, No. 2, June 2012, 101\u2013108\n\n* Nietzsche, prompted by \u201csome enigmatic desire,\u201d has tried for a long time to penetrate pessimism to its depth and in particular to free it from the delusion of morality which in a way contradicts its world-denying tendency. He thus has grasped a more world-denying way of thinking than any other pessimist. Yet a man who has taken this road has perhaps without intending to do this opened his eyes to the opposite ideal\u2014to the ideal belonging to the religion of the future. It goes without saying that what in some other men was \u201cperhaps\u201d the case was a fact in Nietzsche\u2019s thought and life. The adoration of the nothing proves to be the indispensable transition from every kind of world-denial to the most unbounded Yes: the eternal Yes-saying to everything that was and is.\n** [[Leo Strauss]], ''Studies in Platonic Political Philosophy'', p. 180\n\n* Friedrich Nietzsche, the famous atheist and ardent enemy of religion and Christianity, knew more about the power the idea of God than many faithful Christians.\n** [[Paul Tillich]], ''The Shaking of the Foundations'' (1948), Chapter 6. The Escape From God\n\n* Nietzsche is the most impressive and effective representative of what could be called a \"philosophy of life.\" Life in this term is the process in which the power of being actualizes itself. But in actualizing itself it overcomes that in life which, although belonging to life, negates life. \n** [[Paul Tillich]], ''The Courage to Be'' (1952), Chapter 1. Being and Courage\n\n* This divergence and perversion of the essential question is most striking in what goes today by the name of philosophy. There would seem to be only one question for philosophy to resolve: What must I do? Despite being combined with an enormous amount of unnecessary confusion, answers to the question have at any rate been given within the philosophical tradition on the Christian nations. For example, in [[Kant]]\u00b4s [[w:Critique of Practical Reason|Critique of Practical Reason]], or in [[Spinoza]], [[Schopenhauer]] and specially [[Rousseau]]. But in more recent times, since [[Hegel]]\u00b4s assertion that all that exists is reasonable, the question of what one must do has been pushed to the background and philosophy has directed its whole attention to the investigation of things as they are, and to fitting them into a prearranged theory. This was the first step backwards. The second step, degrading human thought yet further, was the acceptance of the struggle for existence as a basic law, simply because that struggle can be observed among animals and plants. According to this theory the destruction of the weakest is a law which should not be opposed. '''And finally, the third step was taken when the childish originality of Nietzsche\u00b4s half-crazed thought, presenting nothing complete or coherent, but only various drafts of immoral and completely unsubstantiated ideas, was accepted by the leading figures as the final word in philosophical science.''' In reply to the question: what must we do? the answer is now put straightforwardly as: live as you like, without paying attention to the lives of others. If anyone doubted that the Christian world of today has reached a frightful state of torpor and brutalization (not forgeting the recent crimes committed in the Boers and in China, which were defended by the clergy and acclaimed as heroic feats by all the world powers), the extraordinary success of Nietzsche's works is enough to provide irrefutable proof of this. '''Some disjointed writings, striving after effect in a most sordid manner, appear, written by a daring, but limited and abnormal German, suffering from power mania. Neither in talent nor in their basic argument to these writings justify public attention.''' In the days of Kant, [[Leibniz]], or [[Hume]], or even '''fifty years ago, such writings would not only have received no attention, but they would not even have appeared. But today all the so called educated people are praising the ravings''' of Mr. N, arguing about him, elucidating him, and countless copies of his works are printed in all languages.\n** [[Leo Tolstoy]], ''What is Religion : Of What Does its Essence Consist?'' (1902), Ch. 11.\n\n* The whole world knows that virtue consists in the subjugation of one's passions, or in self-renunciation. '''It is not just the Christian world, against whom Nietzsche howls''', that knows this, '''but it is an eternal supreme law towards which all humanity has developed''', including Brahmanism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and the ancient Persian religion. And suddenly a man appears who declares that he is convinced that self-renunciation, meekness, submissiveness and love are all vices that destroy humanity (he has in mind Christianity, ignoring all the others religions). One can understand why such a declaration baffled people at first. But after giving it a little thought and failing to find any proof of the strange propositions, any rational person ought to throw the books aside and wonder if there is any kind of rubbish that would not find a publisher today. But this has not happened with Nietzsche\u00b4s books. The majority of pseudo-enlightened people seriously look into the theory of the [[w:\u00fcbermensch|\u00fcbermensch]], and acknowledge its author to be a great philosopher, a descendant of [[Descartes]], [[Leibniz]] and [[Kant]]. And all this has come about because the majority of '''pseudo-enlightened men of today object to any reminder of virtue, or to its chief premise: self-renunciation and love -virtues that restrain and condemn the animal side of their life. They gladly welcome a doctrine, however incoherently and disjointedly expressed, of egotism and cruelty, sanctioning the idea of personal happiness and superiority over the lives of others, by which they live.'''\n** [[Leo Tolstoy]], ''What is Religion : Of What Does its Essence Consist?'' (1902), Ch. 11.\n\n* '''Nietzsche does not favor reckless, anarchic action. The model of the artist, and more specifically the musician, is important.''' Rhythm is of the essence; timing of notes, of actions, allows for a style that is cohesive, even if not uniform. The music that emerges comes out over time, it becomes and develops slowly into a whole that is effective if timed well. Again Nietzsche sees that artists, especially musicians and poets, have such a talent. And to the extent that a writer writes poetically, he also shares in this talent.\n** Diego A. von Vacano, ''The Art of Power: Machiavelli, Nietzsche and the Making of Aesthetic Political Theory'' (2007, Lanham, Maryland: Lexington Books, pp. 99-100).\n\n* After  Nietzsche\u2019s  devastating  criticism  of  those  \u201clast  men\u201d  who  \u201cinvented  happiness,\u201d  there  is  probably no need for me to remind you of the na\u00efve optimism with which we  once celebrated science, or the technology for the mastery of life based on it, as  the path to happiness. Who believes this, apart from a few overgrown children  occupying university chairs or editorial offices? \n** [[Max Weber]], \"Science as a Vocation\"\n\n* There continue to be complex debates about what Nietzsche understood truth to be. Quite certainly, he did not think, in pragmatist spirit, that beliefs are true if they serve our interests or welfare: we have just seen some of his repeated denials of this idea. The more recently fashionable view is that he was the first of the deniers, thinking that there is no such thing as truth, or that truth is what anyone thinks it is, or that it is a boring category that we can do without. This is also wrong, and more deeply so. Nietzsche did not think that the ideal of truthfulness went into retirement when its metaphysical origins were discovered, and he did not suppose, either, that truthfulness could be detached from a concern for the truth. Truthfulness as an ideal retains its power, and so far from his seeing truth as dispensable or malleable, his main question is how it can be made bearable.\n** [[Bernard Williams]], ''Truth and Truthfulness'' (2002)\n\n* '''Anyone who can understand that the Buddhist idea of Nirvana is not merely negative, and that the Buddha himself who (like the Superman) 'looks down on suffering humanity like a hillsman on the planes' is not an atheistic monster, will instantly see how this misses the point. Nietzsche was not an atheist, any more than the [[Buddha]] was. Anyone who reads the Night Song and the Dance Song in Zarathustra will recognize that they spring out of the same emotion as the Vedic or Gathic hymns or the Psalms of David. The idea of the Superman is a response to the need for salvation in precisely the same way that Buddhism was a response to the 'three signs''''.\n** [[Colin Wilson]] in ''The Outsider'', p. 135\n\n* Nietzsche's great concept of Yea-saying gave him a notion of purpose that is seen as positive. Nietzsche, in short, was a religious mystic.\n** [[Colin Wilson]] in ''The Outsider'', p. 275\n\n* The rather more dubious side of Nietzsche's 'evolutionism' is his glorification of the warrior -- particularly when, as an exemplification of the warrior-hero, he chooses an archetypal 'spoilt brat' like cesare Borgia. Nietzsche's own physical weakness and consequent inability to escape the atmosphere of the study leads him to take a rather unrealistic view of the man of action\n** [[Colin Wilson]] in ''Rudolf Steiner: The Man and His Vision'', p. 87\n\n* '''Both Nietzsche and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] did their greatest work seeking to explain the mystery. The term both used was \"decadence.\" '''<br> But if there was decadence, what was decaying? Religious faith and moral codes that had been in place since time was, said Nietzsche, who in 1882 made the most famous statement in modern philosophy \u2014\u00a0\"God is dead\" \u2014\u00a0and three startlingly accurate predictions for the twentieth century. He even estimated when they would begin to come true: about 1915. (1) '''The faith men formerly invested in God they would now invest in barbaric \"brotherhoods with the aim of the robbery and exploitation of the non-brothers.\" Their names turned out, in due course, to be the German Nazis and the Russian Communists.''' (2) There would be \"wars such as have never been waged on earth.\" Their names turned out to be World War I and World War II. (3) '''There no longer would be Truth but, rather, \"truth\" in quotation marks, depending upon which concoction of eternal verities the modem barbarian found most useful at any given moment.''' The result would be universal skepticism, cynicism, irony, and contempt. The First World War began in 1914 and ended in 1918. On cue, as if Nietzsche were still alive to direct the drama, an entirely new figure, with an entirely new name, arose in Europe: that embodiment of skepticism, cynicism, irony, and contempt, the Intellectual.\n** [[Tom Wolfe]], \"In the Land of the Rococo Marxists,\" ''Harpers Monthly'' (June 2000).\n\n* Nietzsche does not simply criticize or reject the impulses of modern morality that make judgments of blame, seek to attach guilt, and invoke a need to pay for the wrongful deed through the counter-hurt of punishment. He says that this morality created human interiority, an ability to hold events in memory over time, and ultimately the strength of a sovereign subject with a sense of responsibility. To be stuck in a spirit of ressentiment, however, leads to nihilism. In the end it is unrealistic and mean-spirited to seek equivalence for every harm that must come from the flesh next to someone\u2019s heart.\n** Iris Marion Young, ''Responsibility for Justice''\n\n* In his book ''Modern Times'', the historian Paul Johnson referred to Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini as the three devils of the twentieth century.

Yet by the time of his death in 1900 at the age of 55, he had become the philosophical celebrity of his age.''' From Russia to America, admirers echoed his estimation of himself as a titanic figure who could alter the course of history: \u201c'''I am by far the most terrible human being that has existed so far; this does not preclude the possibility that I shall be the most beneficial.'''\u201d His origins were humble for the role. \u2026 Suffering from violent migraines, Nietzsche resigned his academic post when he was 34 and began the life of a little-heeded nomad-\u00adintellectual in European resorts. '''With escalating intensity, he issued innovative works of philosophy that challenged every element of European civilization.''' He celebrated the artistic heroism of [[Beethoven]] and [[Goethe]]; denigrated the \u201cslave morality\u201d of Christianity, which transfigured weakness into virtue and vital strength into sin; and called on the strong in spirit to bring about a \u201ctransvaluation of all values.\u201d '''The \u201chigher man\u201d \u2014 or as Nietzsche sometimes called him, the \u201coverman\u201d or \u201c[[\u00dcbermensch]]\u201d \u2014 did not succumb to [[envy]] or long for the afterlife; rather he willed that his life on earth repeat itself over and over exactly as it was.''' In later works, Nietzsche wrote with continued brilliance and growing megalomania of his disdain for the common \u201cherd,\u201d the [[dangers]] of [[nihilism]] and the possibility that the will to power is the \u201c''Ur-fact'' of all history.\u201d '''He spent his last stricken decade in the care of his mother and then his sister, a fervent anti-Semite who would put him in good standing with the German [[nationalists]] he despised.'''<br /> As Nietzsche faltered, his writings began to spread. Small circles of European radicals, literary aristocrats and misfits styled themselves apprentice \u00dcbermenschen, ready to fashion the new values the age demanded. The German aesthete Count [[w: Harry Graf Kessler|Harry Kessler]]  plotted to build a Nietzsche memorial in Weimar with a stadium, a temple and a statue; it would, he hoped, effect \u201cthe transposition of the personality of Nietzsche into a grand architectural formula\u201d expressing \u201cthe unity of lightness, of joy and of power.\u201d '''But if Nietzsche inspired rapture and devotion, he also puzzled and dismayed.''' A sickly recluse with impeccable manners, he praised cruelty and strength. He decried Christianity as \u201ca crime against life\u201d even as he claimed that it made man interesting for the first time, and he proposed that everything we know is merely a partial \u201cperspective knowing\u201d even as he composed some of the most categorical remarks ever made: '''\u201cGod is dead\u201d; \u201cIt is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified\u201d; \u201cThere are no facts, only interpretations.\u201d'''\n\n* While Nietzsche\u2019s early readers took him as an antidote to Americanism, that did not mean they saw him as a representative German. Believing that his ancestors were Polish aristocrats known as Niezky, some attributed his thinking to \u201cSlavic emotionalism.\u201d '''All that changed in 1914, with the start of what a British newspaper called the \u201cEuro-Nietzschean war.\u201d The philosopher of personal liberation was transformed into a proto-storm trooper who believed might makes right and welcomed the sinister rise of the Teutonic \u201cblond beast.\u201d ''' \u2026 If [[Nietzsche]]\u2019s image reached its nadir during the [[Second World War]], when [[Hitler]] presented [[Mussolini]] with a bound edition of his works and the historian [[w: Crane Brinton| Crane Brinton]] wrote a book asserting he would have been \u201ca good [[Nazi]],\u201d a resurrection was soon to come. '''The German \u00e9migr\u00e9 and Princeton professor [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] almost single-handedly revived his standing with his many translations and forceful reminder that Nietzsche hated anti-Semites and German [[nationalists]] as well as woolly-headed romantics.''' Kaufmann\u2019s Nietzsche was a late flower of the [[Enlightenment]], a tough-minded [[rationalist]] with the courage to face the Darwinian revelation that there is no [[purpose]] to [[nature]] or to our existence. '''The true task of the [[overman]] was to overcome himself, not others, and to do so by sculpturing his impulses and thoughts and inheritances into a willed [[unity]] that could be called \u201cstyle.\u201d'''\n\n* '''One can show that [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] anticipated many of [[Nietzsche]]\u2019s most famous utterances. There is a direct line from Emerson\u2019s \u201coversoul\u201d to the \u201coverman.\u201d '''Several decades before Nietzsche wrote, \u201cWhat does not kill me makes me stronger,\u201d Emerson wrote, \u201cIn general, every evil to which we do not succumb, is a benefactor.\u201d '''More profoundly, Emerson foreshadowed Nietzsche\u2019s concern with the ubiquity of flux and power, and the value of overcoming the past.''' \u201cLife only avails,\u201d Emerson once wrote, \u201cnot the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transitions from a past to a new state.\u201d\n\n* '''In every generation Nietzsche finds admirers who blur his message with that of [[Aleister Crowley]], the Nietzsche-reading occultist who wrote, \u201cDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.\u201d '''<br /> If Nietzsche was terrible, was he also beneficial? In a 1985 book \u201cNietzsche: Life as Literature,\u201d the Princeton philosopher [[w:Alexander Nehamas|Alexander Nehamas]]  argued that '''Nietzsche\u2019s perspectivism does not imply that all beliefs are equally valid but that \u201cone\u2019s beliefs are not, and need not be, true for everyone.\u201d''' On this reading, to fully accept a set of beliefs is to accept the values and way of life that are bound up with it, and since there is no single way of life that is right for everyone, there may be no set of beliefs that is fit for everyone. '''At its best, American individualism is not about the aggrandizement of the self or the acquiescent assumption that everybody simply has a right to think what they want.
